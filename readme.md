# Multiuser Sketchpad
simple working demo of multiuser pixel sketchpad, extremely inefficient but going to be used as a background style for my portfolio.
Since this is an expermient, it doesn't work on mobile well.

# Live Demo

See the live demo on <a href="https://clear-great-liquid.glitch.me/">Glitch</a>. Open up in multiple screens/devices to see the working demo.
May take some time to load the app initially, since its hosted on a free service.

# Improvements to be done if I will add it in my website

* Change from using divs for rendering pixels to html canvas
* Split __index.html__ to multiple files.
* Improve code quality
* Add data persistency by using Mongo
